# Study
This repository is my open-source study process documentation. Feel free to check it out (and point out errors).

Short overview:
NeuralNetworks is about http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/ textbook, and mostly done.
DeepLearning is about http://www.deeplearningbook.org/ (by some super cool guys), and I've just started.
