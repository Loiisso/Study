This project is about http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/ textbook.
Theory is solved in tex documents, I haven't yet decided what format should be given for web view.
Each chapter has corresponding "chap_{i}_theory" and "chap_{i}_practice" folders.
"chap_{i}_theory" is presented as tex and (resulting pdf) files
"chap_{i}_practice" is done with either jupyter notebooks, or in "modules" themselves.
