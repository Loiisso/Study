This project is about http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/ textbook.
All problems (except one or two) are solved, so it's officially in beta version)
Further steps - solve one or two, plus comprehensibility edits.

Theory is solved in tex documents, The solutions are in pdf.
Each chapter has corresponding "chap_{i}_theory" and "chap_{i}_practice" folders.
"chap_{i}_theory" is presented as tex and (resulting pdf) files
"chap_{i}_practice" is done with either jupyter notebooks, or in "modules" themselves.

NOTE: 
Chapter 6 is not solved, as it's more of an overview, plus most theoretical questions mostly
repeat previous chapters. Also there is a whole deep learning textbook that I'm working on.
